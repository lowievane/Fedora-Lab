# Deluge

> [Docker Compose file](../stacks/deluge.md)

I use Deluge as my go to torrent client, only to download legal content ofcourse. I've set it up so it immediately downloads to my SMB share. This way I can access all downloaded files from every device in the network. I also use [Jellyfin](jellyfin.md) together with this, it imports all content automatically.
