# Grafana

> [Docker Compose file](../stacks/monitoring.yaml)

Grafana works together with [Prometheus](prometheus.md) for visualistion of metrics.

Dashboards I use and that are compatible with the exporters:
- [System stats](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860-node-exporter-full/)
- [Docker containers](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14282-cadvisor-exporter/)
- [Minecraft Forge server](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16508-minecraft-server-stats/)
